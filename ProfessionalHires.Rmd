### Install Necessary Libraries

```{r}

library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2) 
```

### Store csv file as a data frame

```{r}
ph.df <- read.csv('data/professionalhires.csv')
ph.df
```

### Create Calculated Columns (Percentage)
```{r}

# Calculate total amount of new hires for every year
total.df <- aggregate(. ~ Year, data=ph.df, FUN=sum)

# Add total hires to dataframe
ph.df$TotalHires <- total.df$Count

# Create Calculated Column (percentage)
ph.df$Percentage <- ph.df$Count / ph.df$TotalHires

ph.df

```

### Make some plots/models
```{r}

# Plot percentages over time for each College 

basicPlot <- ggplot(data = ph.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Percentage))

# Colleges separate by color
colorPlot <- ggplot(data = ph.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Percentage, color = College))
colorPlot

# Colleges separate by facets
facetPlot <- basicPlot + facet_wrap( ~ College, ncol=3)
facetPlot




# Add Linear Models





```
