### Install Necessary Libraries

```{r}

library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2) 

```

### Store csv file as a data frame

```{r}

ph.df <- read.csv('data/professionalhires.csv')
ph.df

```

### Create Calculated Columns (Percentage)
```{r}

# Calculate total number of new hires for each year
total.df <- aggregate(. ~ Year, data=ph.df, FUN=sum)

# Add total hires column to dataframe
ph.df$TotalHires <- total.df$Count

# Create Percentage Column (count/total hires)
ph.df$Percentage <- ph.df$Count / ph.df$TotalHires

ph.df

```

### Make some plots/models
```{r}

# Plot total count over time for all colleges
overallPlot <- ggplot(data = total.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Count))
overallPlot


# Plot percentages over time for each College 

basicPlot <- ggplot(data = ph.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Percentage))

# Colleges separate by color
colorPlot <- ggplot(data = ph.df) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Percentage, color = College))
colorPlot

# Colleges separate by facets
facetPlot <- basicPlot + facet_wrap( ~ College, ncol=3)
facetPlot


# still gotta figure out a better way to display plots one by one

# Add Linear Models





```
